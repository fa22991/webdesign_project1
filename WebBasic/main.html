            Why are you are looking for a pure bred, when Adopt pets come vaccinated, neutered and ready to love FOR
            FREE.

            Why would you go anywhere else?

            We provide them with a full veterinary check, we ensure all of the dogs up for adoption are
            sterilized/neutered, receive rabies and basic vaccinations, as well as preventive treatments against worms,
            fleas and ticks.

            Neutering dogs give them better chance to stay healthy and have a good behavior (no fighting or marking
            territory for male, no heat and puppies on female).

            Abandoned pets and stray dogs do not ask for much. All they need is another chance.

            Each year this chance has gives animals a new life through our adoption program.

        <div id="portf">
            The Adopt pets is the result of a collaborative effort between two leading animal welfare groups, the Humane
            Society of the United States and Maddie’s Fund, and the leading producer of public service advertising (PSA)
            campaigns, The Ad Council.
            Our goal is to make shelters the first place potential adopters turn when looking to get a new pet, ensuring
            that all healthy and treatable pets find loving homes. We do this by breaking down misconceptions
            surrounding shelter pets and celebrating the unique bond between every shelter pet and parent.
